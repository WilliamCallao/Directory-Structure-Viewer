# Directory-Structure-Viewer
The Directory Structure Viewer is a Python tool designed to simplify the visualization of folder hierarchies. By accepting a directory path as input, it recursively scans the specified folder and organizes its contents into a tree-like structure. This output includes all subdirectories and files, formatted with clear indentation and symbols to highlight the relationships between folders and their contents. The program is tailored for Windows systems and outputs the structure in a .txt file, providing a portable and human-readable representation of the directory. Ideal for users who need to document file systems, audit storage organization, or understand complex folder structures at a glance.
